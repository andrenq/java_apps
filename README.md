# Grep java app
### Getting Started
For the grep app no instalations are required. All you need is to execute the code.
The code is divided into three files:
 - `JavaGrep` is the application interface. Contains methods and atributes.
 - `JavaGrepImp` is the implementaion of `JavaGrep`. Implements all methods and adds new ones.
 - `JavaGrepApp` contains the main method. It is used to execute the application.
