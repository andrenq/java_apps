# Java Grep app
### Getting Started
For the Java Grep app, no installations are required. All you need is to execute the code using Java 8.
The code is divided into three files:
 - `JavaGrep` is the application interface. Contains methods and attributes.
 - `JavaGrepImp` is the implementation of `JavaGrep`. Implements all methods and adds new ones.
 - `JavaGrepApp` provides the main method. It is used to execute the application.

### Usage
The Java Grep app searches for regular expression on all files inside a base directory and outputs all lines where the regular expression was found to a given file.
